This is a collaborative project involving predictive analytics used to forecast monthly restaurant revenue. The project focuses on developing predictive models for restaurant monthly revenue using performance metrics, which can empower franchise owners and food service industries to make data-driven business decisions. Utilizing a synthetic dataset from Kaggle, we generated regression models in Python via a Jupyter Notebook aimed at minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The models explored include Linear Regression, L1 and L2 Regularization (Lasso and Ridge), and Random Forest Regression.
